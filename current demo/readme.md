# WIP File

### This is a (scratch pad / trial and error).

This is where I play with other techniques to do the same tasks of a previous version.

This is mearly a working safety backup from my development computer. Scripts and Styles must be mapped on your own computer, or just map to its online equivalent.

## The stable versions get migrated to a Version# Folder.

Since this page gets no traffic, I just post my safety save or milestones here.
