My index.html is self contained.

## Before and after:
 
* The first version was a proof of concept and brainstorm of what I wanted the app was supposed to and how it would get used. I was pure CSS and Java Script.
* The 2nd version was a more refined and streamline version with added performance capabilities. Version 2 is predominantly jQuery based code which applies Angular JS and Bootstrap.
 
## jQuery, Angular JS, and Bootstrap: 
 
* TheAngular framework allows for a much faster access and manipulation of DOM elements. The builtin features within Angular and Bootstrap require less lines of code to accomplish similar tasks used in version 1. Many built in feature perform and display the desired outcome in a smootherand more web friendly way.
